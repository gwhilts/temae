Temae

A simple GTD style task manager.

This project exists as place for me to write some code each day, experiment with different tools and framework, and generally keep myself busy.

Feel free to use it, copy it, or basically do whatever you wish with it, but please be aware that it isn't reallydesigned for realworld use. Some of the design and architechual choices exist only because I wanted to see "if i could do it this way...", "what would happen if I ...", or "How to use ... plugin?"
